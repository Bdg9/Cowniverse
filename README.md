# Cowniverse

Welcome to the **Cowniverse** documentation! This prototype originated from the Interactive Game for Children project from the Assistive Technology Challenge. It involves creating a fun game to foster interactions between children with cerebral palsy. The repository is structured into several key components, which are organized into different folders. Below you will find a detailed overview of the contents of each folder.

## Folder Structure

1. **full**
2. **fusion**
3. **library**
4. **test**

### Full Folder

The `full` folder contains the code for the completed prototypes.

- **Prototype 1**: The first complete prototype. This includes all necessary code to run this version.
- **Prototype 2**: The second complete prototype. Similar to Prototype One, this includes all the required code.

### Fusion Folder

The `fusion` folder houses all the CAD files for the different parts of prototype 2. These files can be used for 3D printing or laser cutting the necessary components for the prototype.

- **3d_printed_mounts**: CAD files for the main electronics mounts and the speakers, to 3D print.
- **Box buttons**: CAD files for buttons boxes, to laser cut.
- **Farm**: CAD files for building the farm, to laser cut.
- **Game board**: CAD files for the rounded box, the PET sheet between magnorail and the character and the fixations to close the box, to laser cut.
- **Gate**: CAD files for the gate. The mount for the servos, to laser cut. The sliding mechanism and the mount for the post, to 3d print.
- **Snowboard**: CAD files for snowboards/skates to place the finger puppet on it or a figurine, to 3d print.

### Library Folder

The `library` folder includes the necessary libraries to be installed for the `df_player pro`, which is used in prototype 2. Ensure you install these libraries before running the final prototype.

- **DFPlayer Pro Library**: Download and install this library to ensure proper functionality of the audio components in the prototypes.

### Test Folder

The `test` folder contains Arduino scripts used to test various subsystems of the prototypes. These scripts are helpful for debugging and ensuring each individual subsystem works correctly before integrating them into the full prototypes.
